## Patches

Contributions are always welcome!
It is recommended that you send a message to the mailing list before working on
a larger change.

Patches can be sent to [~gotmax23/fedrq@lists.sr.ht][mailto])

## Linting and Unit Tests

Unit tests are run with `pytest`.
This project uses isort and black to format code, flake8 for linting, and mypy
for type checking.
`reuse lint` is used to ensure that code follows the REUSE specification.
You can install these tools with `pip install .[lint]`
and then run `./lint.sh`.

CI also runs a mock build against rawhide.
Use `./srpm.sh` to build an SRPM containing the git HEAD
and then build the resulting SRPM in the usual way.

builds.sr.ht runs CI for patches sent to the mailing list,
but please run the tests locally before submitting your changes.
See the [.builds] directory for the CI workflow configuration.
